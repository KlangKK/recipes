200	g	quick-cook yellow split peas
800	g	butternut squash
1	dried chilli

2	cloves of	garlic
1	tesapoons	turmeric
2	tablespoons	creamed coconut
10	curry leaves
1	fresh red chilli
2	tesapoons	mustard seeds

Method

Peel, finely chop and add the onions to a pan over a medium heat with a splash of oil. Sweat it down for 10 minutes. 

Add the split peas and 800ml of hot water and bring to the boil, turn down the heat and simmer for 20 minutes. 

Halve, peel and chop your squash into 2cm cubes, then add to the pan and cook for a further 25 minutes, or until everything is soft and the liquid is reduced and creamy, removing the lid for the last 10 minutes. 

Finely chop the dried chilli, then toast with the cumin and coriander seeds in a frying pan over a medium heat for 1 to 2 minutes, or until fragrant.

Using a pestle and mortar, bash everything into a fine powder. 

Finely slice the garlic, then add half to the mortar with the turmeric and coconut and mix it to a smooth paste. 

Stir this through the squash and cook for a further 10 minutes over a low heat until creamy and thick.

Finely slice the chilli and add to a pan with a drizzle of oil, the curry leaves, chilli, mustard seeds and remaining garlic. Fry gently until golden. 

Swirl it through the dal and serve with rice and wedges of lime.
